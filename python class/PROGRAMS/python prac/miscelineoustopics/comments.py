"""A comment is a message to someone reading your program. Comments are often used to describe
what a section of code does or how it works, especially with tricky sections of code. Comments
have no effect on your program."""
# Multi-line comments For comments that span several lines, you can use triple quotes.

# """One nice use for the triple quotes is to comment out parts of your code. Often you will want to
# modify your program but don’t want to delete your old code in case your changes don’t work. You
# could comment out the old code so that it is still there if you need it, and it will be ignored when
# your new program is run. Here is a simple example:"""
